## Competitors list

## Project Description

**Competitor List** is a simple and modern web application for managing competitor data. The project allows you to view a list of competitors, add new competitors via a form, and keeps the data synchronized with a backend API. All operations are performed in real time, and the interface updates automatically when new data is added.

Each competitor has:

RegNumber – registration number of the competitor

Company Name – the name of the company

Registration Date – date of registration

Status – current status of the competitor

Dynamic display – table updates automatically when new entries are added

## Technologies

**JavaScript & TypeScript** – core logic and type safety

**HTML5 & CSS3** – structure and styling

**Fetch API** – GET and POST requests to the backend API

**DOM Manipulation** – dynamic updates of the table and form

**LocalStorage** – storing data locally between sessions
